## [3]Centralised content governance model

Centralised content governance brings a level of strategy, quality standards and a user-focused approach. A central content team oversees content. The team may also be responsible for high-profile services. These may be publishing teams who work on requests from subject experts.

**Pros**: A content strategy, supported by guidelines and templates, encourages capability building. This also helps to build a content community. Quality checks are part of the workflow to ensure continuous improvement.

**Cons**: Often a complex workflow. There can also be delays in negotiating and finalising content.
