Centralised content governance model: long text description

Groups of subject matter experts connect with a dotted line to a pyramid of leaders, doers and specialists. These people apply ‘Strategic content measures and quality checks’ before publishing.

The dotted lines to the pyramid imply that content needs to be checked for quality.  Connecting to the pyramid also implies that strategic content measures and quality checks are part of workflow.

A line from the pyramid goes straight to ‘Publish’.This also implies it is part of workflow.
