Hybrid governance model: long text description

A group of SMEs connect to a pyramid of leaders, doers and specialists.
titled ‘Strategic content measures and quality checks’ that is located in a central position in the diagram.

2 content roles i.e. specialists and subject experts connect by dotted lines to a circle that intersects the central triangle. The dotted lines imply content needs to apply strategic content measures and quality checks. The circle that intersects the triangle implies that quality checks will be applied.

2 lines connect the intersecting circle to ‘Publish’. This implies that this checked content is now ready to publish. It may also imply self-publishing by the content providers.

The other group of 2 content roles, i.e. doers and specialists connect by straight lines that go straight to the triangle. The straight lines imply content is written for quality. The direct lines also imply that strategic content measures and quality checks are part of workflow.

1 line as an output from the triangle goes straight to ‘Publish’.This also implies it is part of workflow.
