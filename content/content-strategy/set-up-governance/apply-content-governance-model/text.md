This model has the least content maturity. Subject experts create and publish their own content. They may also send their signed off content to a publishing team. This can indicate a basic content maturity level with little or no strategy.

### [2]Pros
Faster content approval and publishing.

### [2]Cons

It’s often impossible to oversee quality standards such as plain English, readability, and accessibility. It’s difficult to establish overall editorial consistency.
