A signed-off workflow can improve collaboration and a positive content production process.

Workflow sets out clear interactions between tasks. This allows those involved in content to know what they need to do and when to do it.

People are able to track what stage content is at, who it’s with and what’s left to complete.

Workflow makes it clear for the right people to check accuracy and quality and manage revisions.

Everyone will understand the time frames throughout the stages of the content lifecycle.
