### [2] What you'll get
The list and ecosystem map will show if there is a channel or content problem. This means you need a content strategy. You can also use it to show waste and gain buy-in. It is also the first stage of your content audit which comes later.


Your main artefact is an ecosystem map. This should be put in your [content strategy deck](/content-strategy/start-content-strategy/define-problem/content-strategy-template/)
