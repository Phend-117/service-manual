section: Include diverse users

Understanding and being inclusive of diverse user groups should be an ongoing consideration. 

You need to:
- develop empathy for diverse users, and their needs and capabilities
- challenge your personal biases and assumptions about diverse user groups
- make services accessible for diverse users regardless of their abilities and environments
- [recruit and include diverse users](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/#make-your-research-inclusive) when you conduct end-to-end usability testing
- consider user needs and capabilities when conducting research
- allow any type of user to switch to non-digital channels if needed

Always ask what the user need is and how to meet this need. Be careful not to exclude user groups or make assumptions about what services they might need.

Encourage and enable users to choose and use digital services successfully. Specifically:

- use [plain English](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/)
- deliver a simple and consistent pathway through government websites
- give access to translated content and supporting documentation
- use icons, pictures and visual cues that add to the text content

When you include diverse users in research activities, cater for any access needs or other considerations.

You can also:

- engage a subject matter expert to work with your team — this can ensure you understand and consider issues that affect diverse users
- engage with government or industry working groups, such as the Commonwealth Working Group on CALD Digital Design — email [multicultural.events@humanservices.gov.au](mailto:multicultural.events@humanservices.gov.au)
- engage with trusted intermediaries, such as multicultural service officers in your agency, that address inclusivity considerations

Some ways to encourage empathy for diverse users in your team and organisation are to:
- include team members in usability testing
- share your diversity and inclusivity findings with your team and organisation
