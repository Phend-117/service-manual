As government services move onto digital platforms, we need to make sure they work for everyone. There are many diverse user groups in our population. Currently, many have limited access to digital services or are excluded from them.

Diverse groups include:

- people with low digital skills
- people with low literacy
- older people or seniors
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples
- people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD)
backgrounds
- people with cognitive or physical disability
- people living in rural or remote locations
- people accessing the internet on mobile devices

Accessibility issues affect many Australians across a variety of demographics.

Accessibility issues may include:
- web content that is difficult to understand
- websites not tailored to screen readers
- websites that are difficult to navigate using smartphones
- images that are too big to download without wifi

By addressing accessibility and diversity, we can make our content simple and easy for everyone to understand. You can see some of the latest statistics on Australia's diversity in the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/accessibility-inclusivity/#audience-diversity).
