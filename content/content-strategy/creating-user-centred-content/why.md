Content that is difficult to use and understand can cause frustration and error.
The benefits of providing user-centred content are:

- improved user compliance. Making government services simple helps users do the right thing
- improved user experience. Good user experiences will increase uptake of digital services over alternate methods
- users are able to access a digital service they might not otherwise be able to access. For example, for users with language barriers, this might mean not needing interpreters
- it saves money and time by avoiding unnecessary re-work of products and services
