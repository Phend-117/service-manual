## [2]Step 1: Start with user research
Mental modelling involves [user research](/user-research) to get insight to your user behaviours and thoughts.

## [2]Step 2: Get out the post-its and textas 
Define the scope of the experience you are going to map.

Clear a wall space and get a lot of post-its and textas.

Depending on your project, a mental modelling exercise can be as small or as large as needed.
A small exercise could include a web editor, user researcher, content strategist and user experience or interaction designer focusing on the mental model for a section of a website.

A large mental model exercise could also involve subject matter experts, senior leadership and key decision makers looking at the whole website.

Mental model diagrams map behaviours, beliefs and reactions above a horizontal timeline in towers, while the systems that support these are listed underneath the timeline. See an example of Indi Young’s [mental model diagrams](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/mental-model-diagrams-cartoon/).

## [2]Step 3: Synthesise your notes
Digitise your post-its. 

Start to look for behaviour and thought patterns and group these together. You will start to see the motivations emerge behind certain systems and aspects of your website.

You can then make sure your content matches your user’s mental model.
