A mental model looks at a user’s thought process as they navigate a website or service. This is useful as it helps you anticipate a user’s behaviour, and then design a system that meets the need driving this behaviour.

Mental modelling is a method used in [content design](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/)

Other content design methods include:
- [pair writing](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing)
- [user stories](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/)
- [journey mapping](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/)
- [top tasks](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/top-tasks/)

Mental modelling is part of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/).

A mental model looks at what the user thinks, what they know and how they behave. 

It helps you differentiate your user needs. Different groups of users will have very different needs and, potentially, end goals.

A mental model can help you create content in anticipation of future behaviour. It bridges the gap between what the designer thinks and what the user thinks.
