Top tasks are a useful method used in [content design](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/).

Other content design methods include:
- [user stories](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/)
- [journey mapping](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/)
- [mental modelling](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/mental-modelling/)
- [pair writing](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing)


Users are on your website to complete a task. By prioritising these tasks you can focus on the ‘top tasks’ to meet the greatest number of user needs.

For detailed guidance on top tasks see Gerry McGovern’s article on [A list apart](https://alistapart.com/article/what-really-matters-focusing-on-top-tasks).

The size of your top tasks activity depends on your team's needs, time and budget. For a large scale project, it’s best to use an experienced user researcher, service designer or specialist in this area.
