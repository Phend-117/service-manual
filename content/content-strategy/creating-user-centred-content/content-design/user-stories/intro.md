Writing user stories is an important part of [content design](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/)

Other content design methods include:
- [mental modelling](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/mental-modelling/)
- [journey mapping](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/)
- [top tasks](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/top-tasks/)
- [pair writing](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing)

Writing user stories is a [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/).

A team working to clear user stories will be aligned to work towards the same goal.

Sharing user stories with stakeholders reminds them of the user need behind the content, and then the content’s purpose. 

It’s best to share stories early on in your content development. They outline what you are doing and why, so you are more likely to gain trust and get buy-in early from key decision makers.

A user story map should reflect a broader user journey and show how you can ‘join up’ disconnected or contradictory content across different business areas.
