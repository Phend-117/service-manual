You need to decide on the type of content to meet your need. Content could include text, video, audio, a tool and so on. Think about the best format for your user as this will affect how they access your service or get the information they need.

As part of your content design you might decide that you need to:
- create new content
- reduce content
- break up content into separate pages or topics
- change the format
- [remove content](/content-strategy/removing-content)

Content design works best in an Agile environment with a [multidisciplinary team]('/starting-team/multidisciplinary-team'). When creating new services or improving existing content you should follow the [service design and delivery process]('/service-design-delivery-process') of Discovery, Alpha, Beta and Live. This lets you continually test and improve your content.
