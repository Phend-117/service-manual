For example, a pregnant woman will have to interact with government at different times throughout her pregnancy experience as she applies for financial support, registers her baby, and so on.

User journey mapping is an important method used in [content design](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/)

Other content design methods include:
- [user stories](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/)
- [mental modelling](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/mental-modelling/)
- [top tasks](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/top-tasks/)
- [pair writing](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing)

User journey maps are part of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/).

A user journey map:
- gives you a perspective of the user’s experience, thinking, pain points and points of interaction with your service
- helps define scope and shows you where to solve problems by highlighting user pain points
- breaks down business area silos so you can understand the complete user experience across a service
