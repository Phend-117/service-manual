Good content design begins with user research. This is then translated into simple and clear content that meets a user need. As a content designer you need to:
- think about your problem first
- find a purpose for your content
- define your scope
- create your content around user needs
- balance business priorities with user needs
- present information for your users at the right touch points when they need it
