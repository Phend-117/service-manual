Good content design begins with user research. This is then translated into simple and clear content that meets a user need. As a content designer you need to:
- think about your problem first
- find a purpose for your content
- define your scope
- create your content around user needs
- balance business priorities with user needs
- present information for your users at the right touch points when they need it

### [2]Start with your users

A good content designer always asks what the user need is and how to meet this need. Be careful not to exclude user groups or assume what services users might need. Always think about [inclusivity and diversity](/user-research/identifying-users-needs/#make-your-research-inclusive).

To create user-centred content you need to [research your users](/creating-user-centred-content/using-existing-research), which includes [using existing research](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/using-existing-research/).

Analysing your research will help you [identify users and their needs](/user-research/identifying-users-needs).
