Make sure users find your content [easy to read](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#readability). We recommend a Year 5 reading level (around age 9).

WCAG AAA requires a lower secondary education reading level, after removal of proper names and titles.

You can also use the DTA’s [plain English word list](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#plain-english). For example:

- instead of ‘ascertain’, use ‘find out’
- instead of ‘implement’, use ‘apply’, ‘install’, or ‘do’
0 instead of ‘subsequently’, use ‘after’
