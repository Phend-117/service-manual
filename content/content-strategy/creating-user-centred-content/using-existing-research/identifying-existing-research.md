section: Identifying existing research

Your organisation may already have research about users and their needs. There are many sources you can explore. These include:

### [2]Previous research reports

Many large organisations will already have conducted user research. This research can help you identify different user groups and their needs.

### [2]Other organisational reports

Other reports your organisation creates can also provide information on users. For example, annual reports and strategy documents. These often contain information on numbers and demographics of your users.

### [2]Client engagement or outreach teams

Many organisations have teams that directly engage with clients. These teams can provide valuable insights.

### [2]Call centre data

Call centre data can provide information on your users' main frustrations. Call volumes about different issues can help you prioritise usability issues with your product or service.

### [2]Online and phone surveys

Surveys may already be set up. Use them to find user pain points and areas that need improvement.

### [2]Web analytics

Web analytics involves analysing the behaviour of users on your website. The most common source is Google Analytics. Analytics can help identify usability problems and user types. Often analytics are set up but the data has not been analysed.

### [2]Search logs

Search logs are often overlooked but have a lot of information about what users want and how they look for it. Logs can highlight when users are struggling with language in your site. Looking at search terms can provide guidance on the wordslanguage people actually use. Identifying these problems in the search logs can provide evidence for usability problems.

### [2]Social media responses

Your organisation's social media channels can be a good way to identify trends in users' perceptions of your organisation.
