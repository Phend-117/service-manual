To develop a clear picture of the users, consolidate your research. Read or [analyse](/user-research/analysing-user-research/) the research you have collected. Identify the following:

### [2]User segments and needs

Find out who is using your product and service, and if there are clear groups of users with different needs.

### [2]Key interactions

Find out the common user journeys and user experiences of your service. For example, why did they need to use the service, what did they plan to do and what they did.

### [2]Business needs and organisational cost

Ensure you balance the customer experience with business needs, and the cost and effort it will take to resolve.

### [2]Current usability issues

Prioritise the findings based on user segments and needs.

### [2]Gaps in the research

Identify research that still needs to be done.
