- **Training** 

    Who will need training in your agency and how often is it offered? What is the learning curve like for new people to learn the CMS?
- **Support** 

    Is there a developer community based in Australia? Is it online, face to face, 24/7? Overseas based support can mean a delay in time.
- **Updates** 

    How often is the CMS updated to the next version? How might this affect your website content?
- **Future changes or customisation** 

    If you want to make changes to your CMS in future, what is the process for this?
- **Costs** 

    Write down all the associated costs from initial purchase (if there is one), ongoing maintenance, training, licences, development and support costs.
- **Open-source** 

    Will you or are you using 'open-source' code and technology? This is part of the [Digital Service Standard](https://www.dta.gov.au/standard/8-make-source-code-open/)
