WYSIWYG stands for ‘what you see is what you get’. This is normally the default content editor of your CMS and is sometimes also called a rich text editor. Your WYSIWYG text editor should be configured with your agency style guide.

Your CMS text editor should instruct writers about style and format, including:
- what fonts to use and where to use them – colours, sizes, styles etc
- heading styles

Its editing features should support your content writing. A rich editor with too many options can cause confusion. This happens if writers use styles and features that aren’t in alignment with your style guide.
Does your site uses a lot of imagery. If so, make sure your editor can manage these in an accessible manner. You will need to decide on image formats and specifications.

Questions to ask your CMS developer about the WYSIWYG editor:
- How reliable and secure is the WYSIWYG editor of your CMS?
- How much knowledge of HTML code will you need?

Is it:
- easy to customise content using HTML?
- open source or commercial?
- suitable for everyone who needs to use it
- accessible?
- updated regularly?
- built on current technology
