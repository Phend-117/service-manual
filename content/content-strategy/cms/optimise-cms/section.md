Using your CMS as a service
Think of your CMS as a service, with its users being the writers, designers, developers and other staff people who will use it to manage content. When choosing or developing a CMS, try to involve the writers and designers who will use your CMS. This will help you get a clear idea of what you need your CMS to do.
CMS functionality that is useful includes: 
workflow and roles
navigation tree management
ability to create, edit, approve, publish and unpublish content
ability to manage files within the system
access to support and training
### [1]Actions
Start by listing the specific needs of people who will be using the system. How well will your CMS meet their needs? Focus on the needs of the people using the the CMS, rather than extra features that you may not use.
