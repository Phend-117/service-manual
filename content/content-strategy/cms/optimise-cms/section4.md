Good processes such as workflow are vital to operate a CMS effectively. Make a list of the people who will be using your CMS and what the overall workflow is. Talk with your developer when setting up your CMS. Ensure you have the correct workflow in place for your purposes. 
Consider the following when setting up workflows:
- how easy is it to set up workflow and follow it in your CMS
- if your CMS supports the workflows your agency requires
- if you need to supplement the CMS workflow with your own separate system
- if CMS users easily log in from other locations
- what  each person needs to do with the content
- how many active CMS users you can have at a time
