Should you wish to change from one CMS to another, you will need a clear exit plan. Moving from one CMS to another will involve moving all of your content across. 

Your exit plan should address the following:
- What is the process of moving content, should you wish to change CMS?
- How will data be preserved when you move it across?
- Who is responsible for the migration of content?
- Will content backups be made before and after the move?
- Who will set up content in the new CMS?
