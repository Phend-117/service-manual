There are different CMS tools for different content purposes. Make sure that your CMS can handle your specific requirements. A basic CMS with simple publishing tasks may create problems later on. 

Some common government content types include:
- annual reports
- service pages — such as a government payment page or 'how to' page
- corporate pages — such as about us, vision, mission etc
- news pages
