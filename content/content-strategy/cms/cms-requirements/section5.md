Most CMSs offer training and support. Make sure you ask the right questions when choosing. 
Questions to ask
- what is the cost and frequency of support offered?
- what is the level of support? 
- do updates include functional releases and security patches? 
- how much is the CMS license?
- is there a monthly maintenance plan?
- are there any extra support costs?
- do you have a data disaster plan? Is there a backup of data?
- what are the support response times? Some CMS support is based overseas, so there can be a delay in response times and access to support when you need it.
- how often is the CMS updated, how does this affect content and what are the costs?
