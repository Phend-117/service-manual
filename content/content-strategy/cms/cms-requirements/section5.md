Most CMS suppliers offer training and support but it is important to ensure this is part of the license. You may also want to consider the following:
- the cost and frequency of support offered
- the level of support 
- do updates include functional releases and security patches 
- apart from how much the CMS license costs you should check if there are any extra costs like support or monthly maintenance
- some CMS support is based overseas, so there can be a delay in response times and access to support when you need it.
- how often the CMS is updated and if this affects the content and website.
- if the CMS youâ€™re considering can integrate third party plugins
