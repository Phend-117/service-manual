Hosting and security is vital to any CMS, especially in government. This is an important part of choosing the right CMS. Things like where your website content is hosted and what levels of security are in place, should be considered as part of the choosing process.
### [1]Service level agreement
It is also valuable to ask about a ‘service level agreement’ from your CMS provider. This is the contract that defines the level of service expected from the service provider. It defines what the customer will receive. 
### [1]Security
If you’re working with sensitive content, check that your CMS provides the security levels you need such as two factor identification.

The security requirements of a CMS will depend on the kind of information you’ll be storing in it. You may like to also refer also to the Australian Privacy Principles and the Information Security Manual for more information.

You should also develop a data disaster recovery plan and regularly backup data.
### [1]Hosting
Decide if you want your site and content hosted with Australian servers or overseas. This can also affect costs and support availability. You should also check how frequently your supplier provides patches for the CMS and how often it is update. This keeps your CMS up to date and secure.
