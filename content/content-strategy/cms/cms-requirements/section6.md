One of the most beneficial things a CMS should provide is content flexibility. This includes how the CMS holds and displays content. Make sure the simple things work well, such as link trees, searching the content, making simple updates. A flexible CMS should also be able to work with many different content formats, including:
- content pages
- news items
- documents
- map locations
- video
- images
- audio
- data sources, charts and graphs
- forms
- animations
