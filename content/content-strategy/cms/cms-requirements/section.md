The cost of a CMS should be considered from the very start, as many ongoing costs may not be clear. Consider both the initial costs of set up, as well as ongoing support and maintenance costs. This way you can make an informed decision about how much a CMS may cost you over time.
Take into consideration things like;
- upfront purchase
- licensing costs
- training costs
- upgrading costs
- maintenance/support costs
- changes or customisation costs
- security and hosting
Sometimes these costs will all be rolled into one or they may be separate components.
