Authors and the content they add to a CMS will impact on the accessibility of your site. Even if your CMS is ‘accessible’, the content may not be. This applies to both the frontend and backend of a CMS.
A CMS should also help government agencies manage content to be compliant with accessibility requirements such as [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
