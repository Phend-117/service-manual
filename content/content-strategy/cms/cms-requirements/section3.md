Check if your CMS can support a content distribution network (CDN). A CDN is a global distribution network that serves content to users from a location that's close to them. 

The benefits of a CDN are that they can:
- help reduce the load on your CMS. This includes both traffic and bandwidth, especially for sites with large images or video content.
- provide a content backup.
