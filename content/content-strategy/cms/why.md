A content management system as its name suggests, helps you better manage content. The right CMS makes it easy to:
- create content
- manage/edit content
- store/archive content
- and work with your content as required. 

It can also support things like content workflow, lifecycle, content user roles and content types. Choosing the right CMS and making sure it works for your purposes, is an important part of managing content. A CMS can also be used by people without any knowledge of code.
