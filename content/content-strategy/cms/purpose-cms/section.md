The main purpose of a CMS is to manage content in one place. Your CMS is a support tool for your [content strategy](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-strategy/). It should ensure that content is available in the most useful way possible.

A CMS gives you the tools to fully manage your content lifecycle. This includes:  
- content creation
- editing
- approvals
- publishing
- improving
- maintaining or removing.
A CMS can also be used as the source system where you create original content.
