A content management system, as its name suggests, makes it easier to create, manage, store and work with your content. It also supports things like content workflow, [lifecycle](/content-strategy/manage-content-requests/), user roles (content creators, editors, approvers, publishers) and [content types](/content-strategy/create-content-model/definition-content-model/#content-types/)
