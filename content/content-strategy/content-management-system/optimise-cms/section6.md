Make sure that your CMS can manage your specific content type needs. Things like defining sets of default content fields so that content writers can add content to the relevant fields. This will apply to different types of content and 'chunks' of content on different pages. 

The information entered into your content type fields affect how your CMS displays content on the front end. 

Start by making a list of the types of content you need to make sure the CMS you choose can manage your content types. 

### [2]Setting field names and help text
A CMS should help to manage content in a consistent way. Help text should also be part of your CMS configuration. This describes what content does in a specific field. 

Help text helps authors meet strategic, format and style needs. Templates and content types guide writers by explaining the purpose of different fields and sections in your CMS. 

This can include information like:
- target audience
- style guidance
- example copy
- number of characters

When naming content type fields in a CMS, try to be specific and descriptive. For example, simple field names such as: event name, event description, main event photo, event booking details etc, explain which content goes where.

Help text in a CMS might sound basic, but without it, content may appear in the wrong way. This can cause major problems on the front end of your site. Speak with your developer about optimising your CMS for help text.

Content should always display in a clear way, making it easy to follow and understand.
