A CMS will usually have a:
- development or test site – where changes and new features are built and tested
- staging site – a mirror version of your live site which lets you preview pages before they go live
- production site – your public facing live site

A staging and production site may be enough for agencies publishing simple content.

You need to be clear on how your CMS manages changes to keep improving your website. This includes navigation, functionality and new content requirements.

Consider these questions:
- How many development and staging environments do you need?
- How will data and files flow between ‘staging’ and ‘production’ environments?
- How will developers will pull down a production version of your site that's been stripped of personal or secure information?
- Does the CMS put any restrictions on your preferred deployment methods?

### [2]Preview capabilities
The CMS needs to give you an accurate preview of web pages before they go live. Check this functionality with your CMS provider.

To test open source CMS, you'll need to do some research. Try asking your friendly dev to install a test site. You can also go to the relevant online CMS forum and ask questions there.
