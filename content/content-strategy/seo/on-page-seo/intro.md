On-page SEO is about the quality and relevance of the content on each of your web pages. When SEO is factored into the build and structure of your site itself, things such as metadata, tagging, clear navigation and URLs should already be SEO friendly. A well structured site from the start, can reduce the amount of SEO that needs to be done later.

Other on-page considerations are:
- use of plain English
- short paragraphs
- accurate, up to date content
