Featured snippets (also called rich answers), are selected search results that feature on top of Google's organic results but below the ads in a box. 

**There are 3 types of rich answers:**
- paragraph (an answer is given in text)
- list (an answer is given in a form of a list)
- table (an answer is given in a table)

**You may improve the chances of being a featured snippet by:** 
- optimising your on-page SEO
- creating content that answers specific questions
- aim to answer each question concisely
- make sure one page answers many similar questions (try to avoid turning this into an FAQ page. One option may be to create a ‘people also ask’ box)
