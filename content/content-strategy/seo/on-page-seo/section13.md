Research shows that the majority of users conduct their searches on a mobile device. Google itself may also penalise you with poor search results if your site is not mobile friendly.      

Content should display well on mobile and tablet. It needs to be easy to read on any device, so that users can access your information.

Having a multi-device strategy means planning it in, from intent to launch. It means designing content with devices in mind. A multi-device SEO strategy can also help reach your users more effectively.

[Googleâ€™s mobile friendly test page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly) is a helpful tool to use when testing your website for mobile devices.

For example, with government apps such as [mygov](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwif1bmbgrjWAhVONbwKHaxaApcQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.gov.au%2F&usg=AFQjCNEefvEQZBR1Fc6Ty9olnDoURUCP7g) now being used by more people on mobile phones, you should include SEO for mobile in your content strategy.
