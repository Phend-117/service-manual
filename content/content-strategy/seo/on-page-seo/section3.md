Use heading tags to reinforce a pageâ€™s most important theme. Search engine robots generally place the most weight on an H1 tag followed by H2, H3 and so on.

**Guidelines:**
- use keywords within headers
- every page should have a H1 header
- do not use headers as links
- do not use headers to style font on the site
- only use headers to head up blocks of content
