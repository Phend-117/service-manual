### [2]Meta description
The meta description tag acts as a summary for the content of a page within the search engine listings (SERPS). Good meta descriptions encourage users to click your listing. Think of the meta description tag as your marketing copy or call to action.
Meta descriptions should exist within the head section of the source code of each webpage.

**SEO Guidelines**

Aim to:
- keep meta descriptions below 300 characters (Google increased the character limit for meta descriptions in December 2017 to 300). This doesn’t mean you should go and change all of your meta descriptions. You should still aim to write engaging, user-focused, keyword rich, plain English descriptions.
- use some of your main keywords but make sure the description reads naturally
- address the intent behind the search
- address the user and their needs

**Example**

The correct code for meta descriptions is as follows:
<meta name="description" content="Example meta description goes here”/>

One helpful tool to consider using when testing your meta titles and descriptions is [Moz](https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag). This tool will give you an idea of what your tags will look like in a search result.
