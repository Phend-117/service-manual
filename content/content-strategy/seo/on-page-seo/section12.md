Search engines want to deliver the best possible results for users. As a result, they will consider the user experience of your site for SEO.

Some factors which can affect user experience and SEO include:
- slow page load times
- high bounce rates (users that only visit one page of your site and then quickly leave)
- low average time spent on your siteâ€™s pages.
- what happens when a user clicks on a link. Do your links work?
- how clear is your on site navigation
- does your content pass readability and usability tests
- how many pages do users visit on your site on average
- return visitors - do people come back to your site more than once?
