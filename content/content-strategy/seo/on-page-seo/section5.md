A URL is the actual web address of each page on your site. SEO friendly URLs help users find your content and help search engines understand what your page is about.

**Guidelines**

Aim to:
- use keywords in your URL
- keep URLs short but clear
- make sure you use a consistent, clear format across all of your URLs
- avoid special characters such as & or %
- use verbs where possible. For example, use /apply instead of /applying
- use hyphens (-) to separate words. Do not use any other means. 
- use keywords within your URL structures.

URL structure may also be dependent on how your information architecture (IA) has been set up. See [Information architecture](/content-strategy/information-architecture/) for more on this.

### [2]A note about Google and HTTPS
Talk to your CMS service provider about using the prefix of https in preference to http, for a more secure URL address. If your site does not use the prefix of https, Google may penalise your SEO rankings. See [Search Engine Journal](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-is-requiring-https-for-secure-data-in-chrome/183756/) for more on this.
