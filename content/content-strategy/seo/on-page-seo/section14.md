Duplicate content is when the same content appears in more than one place on a website. It can be inside but also outside of your website.

When there are multiple pieces of content in more than one location on the internet, it can be difficult for search engines to decide which version is more relevant to a given search query, which can impact rankings.

Approaches for dealing with duplicate content;
- Rel=canonical tag — tells Google that you know the article copied has been intentionally placed on your website and that all the weight of that page should pass to the original page.
- Meta Robots Noindex — this meta robots tag can be added to the HTML head of each individual page that should be excluded from a search engine's index.
- Add an external link — simply add a link back to your original page.
