Social posts can help show Google that you are a trustworthy and legitimate website. Whilst the posts themselves may not show up in search results, social media creates traffic and traffic is an SEO signal.

- Do you have reputable social media channels that you create content for?
- Are you linking out to them and are they linking back to your page?

Many government agencies use one or more social media channels. These include: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Linkedin or standalone blog pages. Use your social media channels to help your SEO.

For example, blog pages can be used to create content that will help build your online presence and improve SEO. For example, see the [DTA blog page](https://www.dta.gov.au/blog/).
