## [3]A sitelinks searchbox
A sitelinks searchbox can sometimes be seen in a search result. It's possible to configure your SEO so that a search box may appear within a search result. The benefit of this is that the user can then search directly within your site, straight from the organic search result. This is done through [schema](/content-strategy/seo/on-page-seo/#schema).
