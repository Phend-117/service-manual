[Metadata](/content-strategy/seo/on-page-seo/#metadata) refers to different pieces of code often called ‘tags’. This data sits in the background of a webpage. These tags are not usually visible to users on the webpage, but give information to other sites such as Google or Facebook about your site or page.

Metadata can help control how search engines find and display your site in their results. The most common types of metadata that affect SEO are page titles and page descriptions. Metadata is closely tied to keyword research.
