An algorithm is the set of mathematical rules used by search engines to review data and decide what pages to show in the SERPs for any search query. This algorithm gives relevance and authority to each page, to then give it a ranking. Whilst you canâ€™t know the algorithms, your SEO activity can have a major effect on the data that search engines use, to list your web pages in search results.
