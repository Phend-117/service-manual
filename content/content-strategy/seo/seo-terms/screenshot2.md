## [3]Organic and paid search

**Organic results** (sometimes called natural results) are the main results displayed to users when they search. These appear in a ranking order of highest to lowest. The only way to improve your ranking position is through better SEO.

**Paid results** are not part of SEO. These are paid advertisements (ads) that appear in the search results (either above or to the right of the main SERPs). They are managed separately through programs like Google's AdWords or Microsoft's Bing Ads. The SEO for your site does not directly affect these paid listings.
