SERP stands for search engine results page. These refer to the actual search results a user sees in a list, after they’ve done a search. 

In a typical search, you’ll see both paid listings and organic listings. The SERP page will consist of 10 organic results. Each result will have as a minimum:
- a headline — known as a meta title or page title
- a description — known as a meta description
- a URL link — the website page link itself

These 3 pieces of information can be modified and optimised for SEO.

Some SERP results can also include extra information such as navigation, website headings, names of people, search bars etc. This extra information is called rich snippets, and depends if your pages have been set up to maximise SEO.

### [2]Search results can vary
Each time a user does a search, the results can vary, even on the same search done twice. Some factors are out of your control such as a user’s browsing history, location and social media settings. This is why the quality of your content itself becomes vital for successful SEO.
