Also called search terms or search queries, [keywords](/content-strategy/seo/on-page-seo/#keywords) are the common terms people mostly use when searching for information. When a person types a keyword or keyword phrase into a search bar, this can be referred to as a ‘search term’ or ‘search query’. If you decide to target one of these ‘search terms’ in your SEO strategy, you would then refer to it as a keyword.
