### Start a spreadsheet
Use a spreadsheet template to create a complete list of the above data as evidence about your content assets.

Otherwise export your pages to a spreadsheet from a CMS or analytics tool to give you a complete list of all pages on the site. Remove content that is not a true page (for example, search result query string URLs) or pages not included in the content audit.

## Categorise the data
Break the content down into content types for ease of reviewing. For example, news content, legal content, article page and so on.

You should also show the content hierarchy.

## Assign owners
Assign page owners or subject experts to each item in the spreadsheet. You will need to get their agreement to action findings for content sections. Also make a note if there is no owner. 

For maintaining and updating content metadata (such as page owners) where possible, store this data with the content, within the CMS.

## Next steps
Once you’ve started to decide on your content, begin the analysis. Add in your qualitative and quantitative assessment and web content analytics.

To validate your audit spreadsheet, consider testing it with others in your team first to make sure:
  * your colleagues are testing content against criteria in the same way
  * you’ve chosen relevant criteria to measure your website
