Setting a goal for your content strategy should start with your agency’s corporate strategy and plan. This will detail vision, mission and outline the agency’s goals, objectives and performance criteria. Combining these [business needs](/content-strategy/identify-business-needs/) with [user needs](/content-strategy/define-user-content-needs/) will give the basis of your strategy and set you up to develop the goals and objectives of your content strategy.
