Following are some examples of metrics you can use.

### [1]Average session duration

Find out how long users are spending on the website per visit. This is a good indicator for how relevant the website is for user needs.

### [1]Content cost 

An effective way to show the value of your content strategy is to calculate the cost of production. Savings can be made by developing good processes and content.

### [1]EXAMPLE

A recent study by Adobe shows that the average cost of an online transaction is 40c.  This compares to $6.60 for a telephone call, $12.79 for a postal transaction and $16.90 for a face-to face visit.
Use these figures to show the importance of getting online transactions right.
