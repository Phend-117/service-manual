### [1]Decide on the right metrics

Deciding on the right metrics is the first step to enable you to measure success. Then set your KPIs to show the content is improving. 

There are a lot of analytics you can use. It is better to measure less metrics but measure them consistently and analyse them. You will gain valuable insights by monitoring change over time. 

The 3 objectives set for the Digital Transformation Agency's content strategy are:

1. less content
2. better content
3. more efficient

If you choose to use these as your own objectives, then following are some metrics to track content performance.

### [2]1. Less content
3 ways to measure the less content objective:
- reduction in the number of channels - count them and compare against a baseline
- reduction in the number of pages per channel. Your content audit will show you which pages are redundant
- reduction in duplication across channels - find them, count them and compare against a baseline

### [2]2. Better content
### [1]Usability
2 ways to measure usability:
- effectiveness - content needs to answer the user need it was designed for. This can be measured by whether users were able to complete their goal. A feedback mechanism on each page would be a great tool for measuring this. 
- efficiency - content needs to be easy to find. How quickly users are able to complete their task or meet their need. 

### [1]Findability
3 ways to measure findability:
- time - how long did it take a user to find what they were looking for?
- search - how many times did they have to search to find what they were looking for?
- bounce - the percentage of users who leave after visiting just one page

### [1]Accessibility
All users should be able to access the content including those with a disability or language challenges.
3 measures for accessibility:
- people from culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) backgrounds can use the content
- compliance - WCAG 2.0 level AA compliance 
- readability - content should have a Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level at or below year 9

### [2]3. More efficient
3 ways to measure reduced cost:
- reduced failure demand 
- estimated cost of content production per piece of content or section. You could also calculate this against number of visits to the content to determine ROI
- reduced cost per piece of content


### [2]Other metrics you could use
Learn which metrics to use and how to interpret your website’s analytics. The power of data is in cross referencing. For example, using ‘time on site’ might show that visitors are not spending much time on a page. This could be a good result showing that users are finding what they need. Or it could show the content is not meeting user needs and they are bouncing (leaving) the page quickly.
