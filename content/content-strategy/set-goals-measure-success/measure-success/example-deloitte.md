### [1]Example - The cost of online transactions vs online

A recent [study by Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/au/Documents/Economics/deloitte-au-economics-digital-government-transformation-230715.pdf) shows that the average cost of an online transaction is 40c.  This compares to $6.60 for a telephone call, $12.79 for a postal transaction and $16.90 for a face-to face visit.
Use these figures to show the importance of getting online transactions right.
