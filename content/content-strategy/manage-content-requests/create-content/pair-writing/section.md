section: Why use pair writing
---
### [1]Materials
- a laptop or paper, depending on your preference
- a quiet space to write

### [1]Preparation
It is useful for a writing pair to include a subjectg expert and a content expert. This can be one-on-one or in a workshop scenario with several pairs working at once.

If you are working remotely, you can pair write using video conferencing and a collaborative tool such as Good Docs or Microsoft Word.

Be clear to your partner about:

- how much time you need from them
- the structure of the writing sessions
- deadlines

Let your partner know they are there for their expertise in a certain area. They don't have to be a strong writer.
