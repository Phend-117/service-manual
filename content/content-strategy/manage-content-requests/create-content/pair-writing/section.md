## [2]Materials
- a laptop or paper, depending on your preference

## [2]Preparation
It is useful for a writing pair to include a subject expert and a content expert. This can be one-on-one or in a workshop scenario with several pairs working at once.

If you are working remotely, you can pair write using video conferencing and a collaborative tool such as Good Docs or Microsoft Word.
