### [1]Step 1: Use pain points to write your stories

Once you have collected your user pain points you can write your stories in response to them. Jot them on an index card so you can visualise and group your stories.

The most common format for a user story is:
  * As a … (who is the user: be as specific as possible)
  * I want to / need to … (what task is the user trying to do)
  * So that … (why does the user want to do this task and what is their goal)

For example:
  * As a young person entering the workforce for the first time
  * I need to know what I should be getting paid (minimum wage)
  * So that I can negotiate/check this with my employer

### [1]Step 2: Start broad, then get detailed

Keep your stories simple, focused, concise and active. Begin with broad stories by focusing on the overall goal. Then gradually break this down to create stories that reflect an individual task.

For example, an overarching story might be:
  * As a content designer
  * I need to create user-centred content
  * So that my content meets a user need

A more detailed task-based user story under this could be:
  * As a content designer
  * I need to understand readability requirements
  * So that my content is clear and accessible to people with low literacy levels

### [1]Step 3: Work out if you need job stories

Job stories can be used when you have the same user/s for each story and your stories are starting to sound repetitive. A job story helps you create more detail.

Job stories follow the format:

  * When … (what situation is the user in)
  * I want to … (what is the user trying to do or need)
  * So … (what is the user’s goal)

For the readability example above, the user is a content designer and the job story could be:

  * When I am creating content
  * I want my content to be written simply
  * So that people with lower literacy levels can understand it
