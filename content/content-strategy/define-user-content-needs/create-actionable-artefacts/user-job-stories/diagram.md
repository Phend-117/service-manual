### [1]Step 4: Write acceptance criteria
Write acceptance criteria on the back of your index cards to measure how your content meets a user or job story. When you meet the acceptance criteria you have completed the story.

For our readability example in the user story above, acceptance criteria might be that:
  * content is in plain English
  * content was tested with a readability tool and scored between a Year 5 (around age 9) and Year 9 (around age 13) reading level
  * content is tested for comprehension with users
Acceptance criteria should state a high-level intent, rather than a solution. Use acceptance criteria to test your content and measure performance.

### [1]Step 5: Map your stories

Map your user story cards in a tree format. Start with the broad overarching stories at the top of the tree and then map more specific user needs below this.

Group related tasks together so you can visualise how the content may fit together to meet a certain need.

Mapping your needs will also help you outline your minimum viable product (MVP). This shows the minimum stories you need to work to for the content to meet the overall goal.

By prioritising content this way, you can create an MVP for testing. Everything not prioritised can go in your backlog to work on later.
