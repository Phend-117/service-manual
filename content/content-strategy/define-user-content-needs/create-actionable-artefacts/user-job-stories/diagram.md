### [3]Step 5: Map your stories

Map your user story cards in a tree format. Start with the broad overarching stories at the top of the tree and then map more specific user needs below this.

Group related tasks together so you can visualise how the content may fit together to meet a certain need.

Mapping your needs will also help you outline your minimum viable product (MVP). This shows the minimum stories you need to work to for the content to meet the overall goal.

By prioritising content this way, you can create an MVP for testing. Everything not prioritised can go in your backlog to work on later.
