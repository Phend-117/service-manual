Redirects are a part of removal. They make sure:
- you give users with options to continue their search for information  
- your website keeps its search engine optimisation (SEO) integrity
- your website looks maintained

Talking to your ICT department is the usual process. Give them with the list of your deleted URLs with the new URLs you’d like to redirect to. Add the date to go live, so the redirect process doesn’t happen before you remove content.
When redirecting, you should consider the user journey and SEO, pointing people to the information that’s the most relevant.

Tip: Even if pages receive no traffic, it’s still important to remove and redirect them to:
- retain your SEO integrity
- lower maintenance costs
- reduce the amount of GOV.AU domains that currently exist

### [2]Using 404 pages
Use 404 pages only when they are a necessary part of the user journey. It should be easy for the user to understand the page no longer exists. Give them an obvious search option to find their content.
