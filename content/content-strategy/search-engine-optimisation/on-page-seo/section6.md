Internal linking helps search engines understand the structure of your website, the topics and themes of your content. The keywords used within the anchor text (the actual words you link to) also play a valuable role. They help search engines work out the relevancy between pages and the importance of a page, by the quantity of internal links pointing to it. 

**Guidelines**

Aim to:
- link to relevant and important pages on the site
- use descriptive keywords in anchor text that give a sense of the topic

### [2]Internal site search
Internal site search is the search that users do on your site. If a user has found your site via a search engine, make it the best user experience possible, with effective internal site search.

When you make improvements for SEO externally, consider if and how these changes can be made to improve your internal search also.

Google no longer reveals search terms via its analytics, unless you are using its paid search service. As a result, internal search may be your best source of discovering search terms to help improve your content. Keep in mind, when a user searches via a search engine, other factors will also affect results such as: browsing history, location, cache etc. In this way, each person will see different results.

Keep track of the relevant keywords and search terms people are using on your site. This can be done through your own internal search functionality in your CMS and site analytics.
