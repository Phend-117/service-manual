**Page titles** are a foundational part of SEO. They're one of the first things a user sees in the search results. 

Search engines also use your page title or title tag to work out what your webpage content is about.

Aim to:
- keep title tags between 6 to 9 words, including main keywords
- place keywords at the beginning of the title
- place the agency name at the end of the title
- keep titles below 70 characters, including spaces and symbols
- place your title tags within the header section of the source code of each webpage

In this example, the You Tube title tag is above the URL address on a separate tab.
