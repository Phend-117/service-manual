As many pages may be relevant to a keyword, search engines also use content authority to help rank pages in SERP listings. The biggest factor to influence this is backlinks (links coming in from other reputable organisations, agencies or departments).

Other factors can include making your content educational and informative. Set out a list of topical questions that are relevant to your users and write content to give simple answers and solutions. Try to avoid listing FAQs (frequently asked questions).
