Successful SEO is about prioritising content and its order on a page by page basis. SEO works better when itâ€™s targeted. Be specific about where you want people to land when they come to your site. Do you want users to land on specific pages for example? 

Optimising certain pages should also be part of your SEO strategy, as well as optimising your whole site. Good SEO happens when you are focused on user needs. 

Things such as clear page titles, subheadings, backlinks and strategic keyword use will all help to ensure your site performs well from an SEO perspective.

Planning your content will help users to find top level information. It will also help search engines understand the main purpose of your pages.
