### [2]Keyword research
This is the method of finding the right keywords to target within your content. This is covered in the [DTA Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/search-engines/#keywords).

### [2]How to do keyword research
If you have an [Adwords account](https://adwords.google.com/intl/en_au/home/tools/keyword-planner/), you may want to look into Google’s Keyword Tool. It shows:
- how many people are searching for your keywords
- what your competitors’ keywords are doing
- other good keywords

You can also use any other keywrod tool that provides you with keyword suggestions and just pull in the data for those keyword from AdWords.

**Researching keywords with AdWords:**
1. Generate common keywords — this can be a short list of words you think users will search for.
2. Download suggested keywords — add each keyword to Google Keyword Tool and download this list and any similar terms in in csv files.
3. Import keyword data into a single worksheet.
4. Add extra keyword data from other SEO tools.
5. Create filters to remove keywords that are not relevant, competitive or valuable.

Keyword research helps you find the best keywords. You can then write content using those keywords.

### [2]Mapping keywords
Once you have your list of keywords, you can start to map (assign) them to your content pages. After you’ve exported the keywords, remove keywords that are duplicated, not relevant or of low value.

Use search volume and competition metrics to help pick keywords. Then assign these keywords in very small groups (1 to 3 keywords) to relevant pages on your site.
