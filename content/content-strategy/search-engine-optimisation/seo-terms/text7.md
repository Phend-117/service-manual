Sometimes also called inbound links. These link back to your content from other websites. Search engines rank the quality of these backlinks, which in turn helps to strengthen your SEO. 

Other sites linking back to yours could be other agencies, trusted organisations, departments, businesses or individuals such as a Minister’s blog site.

There are two broad components of a backlink. These are the ‘quality’ and the ‘quantity’. You want as many quality backlinks to your site as possible. This will help give your content authority, as search engines will consider your content valuable enough for other sites to be linking back to. The best link strategy are the ones that link directly to your keywords.
