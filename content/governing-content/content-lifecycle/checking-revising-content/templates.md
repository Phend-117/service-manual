Use tools to check the readability of your content. Aim for [Year 5 reading level](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/writing-style/#readability) (the same level a 9 year old can understand). When writing to government and industry users, aim for Year 5 but donâ€™t go above a lower high school reading level.
