- Allocate 2 hours for your activity
- Invite people from your immediate team or from across your agency. Involve those who request, plan, write, check and review, produce and publish content
- Write 2 sets of content lifecycle stage headings across a wall. Break participants into 2 groups of 3 to 4 people
- You will need to assign:
    -  a facilitator to each lifecycle stage group
    -  a timekeeper for the exercises
    -  a note taker during share back to capture participantsâ€™ subtext. The notes will be useful in defining your next steps.
- Have a supply of sharpies and post-it notes in 3 different light colours (for roles, tasks and skills). Use red dots at the end of the exercise to call out where there are gaps.
