### [3]Why create user-centred content?

The benefits of providing user-centred content are:

- improved user compliance — making government services simple helps users do the right thing
- improved user experience — good user experiences will increase uptake of digital services over alternative methods
- users are able to access a digital service they might not otherwise be able to access — for example, users who speak languages other than English may not need to use interpreters
- savings in money and time by avoiding unnecessary re-work of products and services
