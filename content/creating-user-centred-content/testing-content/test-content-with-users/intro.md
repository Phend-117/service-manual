Testing content is a part of usability testing, and involves:

- observing users using your content (on-site or remotely)
- recording your observations
- identifying problems and areas it could be improved

At a minimum, usability testing needs a small sample size of real, representative users to identify issues. Our recommended sample size is 5 to 10 people. This should happen [throughout the design process](/user-research/research-stages/).

We recommend doing a series of small studies instead of investing in one large scale survey.

Usability testing can test your content for:

- readability
- findability
- comprehension
- agreeability and tone
- favourability
- effectiveness

It can also test if your content supports an interactive process, like completing a form.
