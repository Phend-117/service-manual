Conduct task-based observation testing with users of your service. This is where users complete typical tasks while observers take notes.  

You can test usability of your content designs using [prototypes](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/prototyping.html). Prototypes can be low fidelity paper samples of content, or higher fidelity mock-ups for screen-based testing.

## [2]Cognitive load testing
Tests if your content is easy to understand.

## [2]Eye tracking
[Tracks eye movements](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/eye-tracking.html) of users to test if they can easily find information in your web service, and other behaviours.

## [2]A/B testing
Testing transactional content can be done through A/B testing. This involves showing two versions of your content to users, to see which performs better.

For example, you might want to test online content that is part of an application process. You can do scenario-based testing and show half your testing participants design A (the existing content). Show design B (new content) to the other half.

Compare each group of participants. Observe higher rates of successful completion of the application process. You should assess:

- if they submitted the application
- how long they took
- how easy they rated the process
- any wrong clicks they made during the process
