Test your content early in the design process. Continue to test from the Discovery stage through to the Live stage:

- In [Discovery](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-discovery-stage), find out about your users so you can understand how the content you’re designing can meet their needs.
- During [Alpha](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-alpha-stage), test your content designs with users.
- During [Beta](/user-research/research-stages/#user-research-in-beta-stage), continue to test your content, in order to refine it for launch.
- When you move your content to [Live](/user-research/research-stages/#researching-when-your-service-is-live), keep testing to make sure it’s still meeting user needs.
