An informal critique session with colleagues can be a useful way to get quick feedback. Ideally, the session should be led by someone in the team.

Critiques are an easy way for new eyes to see your content and to fix problems you may have missed.

### [2]Critique process

A content critique involves:
- the content designer sharing their content with others in the session
- the designer discussing the design process and user needs
- collaborative editing and discussion of how to improve the content
- noting action items for further editing

Try to include people from different disciplines to get fresh ideas and perspectives.

A content critique should be a positive, constructive forum. For example, if you raise an issue with the wording of a sentence, also try to offer a solution.

Content critiques can allow others to give feedback about elements like:

- readability
- comprehension
- effectiveness
- tone
