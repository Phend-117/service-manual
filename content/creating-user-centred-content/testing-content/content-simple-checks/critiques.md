An informal critique session with colleagues can be a useful way to get quick feedback. It should ideally be facilitated by someone in the team.

Critiques are an easy way for new eyes to see your content and to fix problems you may have missed.

### [2]Critique process

- Content designer shares the content with people in the critique.
- Designer discusses the design process and user needs.
- Collaborative editing, and discussion of how to improve the content.
- Action items for further editing are noted.

Try to include people from different disciplines to get fresh ideas and perspectives.

A content critique should be a positive, constructive forum. For example, if you raise an issue with the wording of a sentence, try to offer a solution also.

Content critiques can allow others to give feedback about elements like:

- readability
- comprehension
- effectiveness
- tone
