By testing for accessibility, you can improve your content for all users. This includes users who:

- are blind or have vision impairments
- have colour vision deficiency
- have motor difficulties with their hands or arms that make it hard to use a keyboard or mouse
- have neurological conditions
- have cognitive or learning disabilities
- are deaf or have a hearing impairment

Weâ€™re working on guidance about testing content for accessibility, which we will publish soon.
