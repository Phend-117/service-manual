Pair writing is an important method used in [content design](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/)

Other content design methods include:
- [user stories](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/)
- [journey mapping](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/)
- [mental modelling](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/mental-modelling/)
- [top tasks](/content-strategy/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/top-tasks/)

Mental modelling is part of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/).

The benefits of pair writing are:
- you are both creating content to the same user needs
- your subject matter expert will gain understanding of the content creation process
- continual feedback and input improves the content quality
- the content is fact checked as you have the subject matter expert there with you
- it helps you create an awareness of content design in business areas
- it speeds up the content approval process as key content decision makers are involved early on in the content development
- it avoids time-consuming back-and-forth dialogue of feedback between writer and subject matter expert
- the content will follow the appropriate style and tone, in line with the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/)
- there is less chance of error and miscommunication between teams

Itâ€™s best to do a pair writing exercise at the start of content development, after you have completed [user research](/user-research).
