Content design skills include traditional editorial and writing skills, along with:
- writing and editing digital content
- user research
- service design
- stakeholder engagement

The best way to become upskilled in content design is to work in a [multidisciplinary team](/digital-service-standard/2-multidisciplinary-team/) to share knowledge, skills and processes.

Content designers often have backgrounds in areas like web editing or online copywriting.
For more information about content design read Sarah Richardsâ€™s articles [Copywriter to content designer](http://contentdesign.london/content-design/copywriter-to-content-designer/) and [Content design versus editorial](http://contentdesign.london/content-design/content-design-vs-editorial/).

Good content design begins with user research. This is then translated into simple and clear content that meets a user need. As a content designer you need to:
- think about your problem first
- find a purpose for your content
- define your scope
- create your content around user needs
- balance business priorities with user needs
- present information for your users at the right touch points when they need it
