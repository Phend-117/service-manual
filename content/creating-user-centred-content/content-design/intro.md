Content design helps users find the information they need quickly and easily. This is done by creating content that meets user needs.

Content designers have traditional writing and editing skills and work closely with user researchers, service designers, interaction designers and developers. They aim to create content that puts the user at the centre of the design process.

When designing content always refer to the [Content Guide](https://guides.service.gov.au/content-guide/).

For more information read the GOV.UK [Introduction to content design: what is content design?](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/what-is-content-design)

There are several content design methods, including:
- [user stories](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/user-stories/)
- [journey mapping](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/journey-mapping/)
- [mental modelling](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/mental-modelling/)
- [top tasks](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/top-tasks/)
- [pair writing](/creating-user-centred-content/content-design/pair-writing)

Content design is a part of the [service design and delivery process](/service-design-delivery-process/).
