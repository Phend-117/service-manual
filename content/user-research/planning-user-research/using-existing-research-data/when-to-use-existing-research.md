section: When should you use existing research?
---
Use existing research as a starting point to find out about all the possible users of your service. It can help you find out about your users and their needs. 

However, you shouldn’t rely on existing research as being comprehensive, as:  
- sometimes sources may be limited or dated
- it may not address your specific context or problem
- it won’t help the team to develop a deep understanding and empathy of the service's user needs

Existing research shouldn’t replace your own user research. User research is the best way to learn about users and create services that meet their needs.
